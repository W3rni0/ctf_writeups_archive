# CTF Writeups Archive

This is an archive for CTF writeups I started but didn't manage to finish as of now or didn't like the quality of, if it's because I haven't solved enough interesting challenges or because I felt like I couldn't explain the challenges properly and in a meaningful way.

In spite of that, I believe that there are some writeups for challenges that could possibly be meaningful to someone out there so I chose to publish them anyway in this repo instead of publishing each one separately.\
But, beacuse of the above I can't guarantee that all the explanations are comprehensible and correct and that all the scripts will work (if you find any problems feel free to let me know), thanks for reading!
